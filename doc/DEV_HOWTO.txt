Software requirement
=======================
1. JDK 1.7+
2. Apache Ant 1.7.1+
Uncompress the source package and enter the top of directory.

How to build the source code
=============================
1. Make sure jmemcached-core-1.0.0.jar is in the lib directory
2. Run the following command, binary and test jar package will be generated for you.
ant jar
3. java_memcached-release_{version}.jar is the binary package.
4. java_memcached-release_test_{version}.jar is the test package.

Unit test and code coverage
============================
1. Open build.properties and set the entry "memcached.host" points to the
address of memcached server like this <hostname:port>.
2. Run the ant task:
ant
3. When the ant task finishes successfully, a directory named report will
be created and all the unit test reports are in the directory. "index.html"
is the entrance of the unit test report and "coverage.html" is the entrance
of code coverage report.

Simple performance test
========================
1. MemCachedBenchTcp
java -Dmemcached.host=<hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2> \
	-cp .:schooner-memcached-client-test-1.0.1.jar:schooner-memcached-client-bin-1.0.1.jar \
	com.schooner.MemCached.MemCachedBenchTcp <runs> <start>
	
2. MemCachedBenchUdp
java -Dmemcached.host=<hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2> \
	-cp .:schooner-memcached-client-test-1.0.1.jar:schooner-memcached-client-bin-1.0.1.jar \
	com.schooner.MemCached.MemCachedBenchUdp <runs> <start>

Advanced checker
=================
The advanced checker provides some dynamic test features. It can be configured through XML file:

You can find the default configuration file("adv_config.xml") in root directory of the source code.

The advChecker will verify memcached client periodically and write error log into file "advChecker_errors.log"
if we can't retrieve the stored data.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rule thread="8" runtime="60" sleep="2000" checkInterval="10000">
	<op name="set" percent="40"></op>
	<op name="get" percent="20"></op>
	<op name="delete" percent="10"></op>
	<op name="add" percent="10"></op>
	<op name="append" percent="10"></op>
	<op name="prepend" percent="10"></op>
</rule>

thread: the number of thread;
runtime: the run time of the checker;
sleep: the sleep time between two operations;
checkInterval: the time interval between two checks.
name: command name;
percent: The proportion of this command.

run the advanced checker:
java -cp .:schooner-memcached-client-test-1.0.1.jar:schooner-memcached-client-bin-1.0.1.jar \
